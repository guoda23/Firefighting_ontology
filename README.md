This repository contains a firefighting ontology. The data included is a case study for buildings at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.
Many (commercial) organizations are required to have an emergency respose organization on site. Our ontology focuses on representing
the responses of such an organization ("Bedrijfshulpverlening") to different fire accidents on campus.

Note that the data used is AI-generated and not factually correct.
